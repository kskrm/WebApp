**<About This Project>**
 This application is made for user who have many friends and celebrate their birthdays every year.
This application will help them remember their birthdays and you can check what presents user gave to their friends,
so that user can select best and yet given presents to their beloved friends.
 These ideas came from my own experience. When I was young, I didn't have so many friends so I coud remember their birthdays and celebrate them.
Also, I know their preference from the presents I gave them in the past, so I could surpass their expectations of present.
However, as I go to High School and University, I made more friends, and I sometimes forgot their birthdays or I geve present that I had given.
When these things happen, feelings of me and my firends became kind of sadness.
From these experience, I wanted something to manage my friends' birthdays, so I made this application.
 To create this application I needed to understand the lesson of week 9 from cs50. Based on knowledge of the lesson, I struggled to add one function.
It is a function to calculate current age from birthdate. I made birthdate to be added to the database in format of yyyy/mm/dd.
To calculate current age from the birthdate, I had to separate year and month and day. To enable this, firstly change the data format from yyyy/mm/dd
to yyyy-mm-dd, and calculate year and month and day separately.
 Actually, I wanted to make web application that has more usable and complicated features, such display days to next birthday or alert registered birthday.
However, in a fixed amount of time, I wanted this application simple and easy to use. As a result, the outcome might be better one, not the best one.
I think making better one and focusing on main functions, this application will be received by masses.
 Finally, I want to thank David, who gave easy to understand lessons for beginners and power to make my idea into reality through programming.
I thought it was difficult to do programming, but now I became curious and want to keep learning programming more. Thank you for all.
